Classification is a supervised learning technique where the model predicts discrete class labels.

Binary classification involves two classes, such as spam vs not spam.
Multi-class classification involves more than two classes.

Logistic Regression is a linear model used for binary classification. It uses the sigmoid function to output probabilities.

Decision Trees classify data by recursively splitting features based on conditions.

Classification models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Accuracy measures overall correctness.
Precision measures correctness of positive predictions.
Recall measures how many actual positives were correctly identified.
